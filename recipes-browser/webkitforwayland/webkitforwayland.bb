SUMMARY = "WebKit for Wayland port pairs the WebKit engine with the Wayland display protocol, \
           allowing embedders to create simple and performant systems based on Web platform technologies. \
           It is designed with hardware acceleration in mind, relying on EGL, the Wayland EGL platform, and OpenGL ES."
